// A palindrome number is defined as one which is the same forwards and backwards. For example,
// 121 is a palindrome. Reading from the left or the right, the number is the same â€“ 121. Another
// example of a palindrome is 22.
// In contrast, 354 is not a palindrome since it reads 354 from the left (forward), and 453 from the
// right (backwards).
// Your task is to take any number as input from the user (in integer form) and check whether it is a
// palindrome or not, showing the result on the screen.
